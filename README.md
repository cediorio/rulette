# Rulette
Rulette is a simple javascript expert system. It is backward-chaining (for now) and it focuses on allowing the user to be able to write a rulebase in simple pseudo-code. Its author is a tax lawyer with no memory who is very tired of having to re-learn the rules for non-resident trusts every 9 months when a question comes up.

Note that this library is currently very much in development, but does have fairly decent test coverage.
